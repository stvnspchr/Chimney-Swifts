### Settings ###

The Media Settings are already set for you by the theme. If you want to check the dimensions, please go to Settings -> Media page.


### Theme Customizer ###

With the Theme Customizer, you can set your title and tagline, upload a logo, choose your fonts, set a background image, assign your menus, and choose a static home page. You can preview your changes by clicking the Customize link below your active theme on your Appearance &gt; Themes page.

*Please note: Setting a static home page will remove the default home page elements built into the theme.


### Header Image ###

This theme supports header image. Header images should be sized at 1100 px wide by 800 px tall. If you have a larger image, you can crop it after you upload the image. The Header Image appears on the first page of the website where you can see the Site title and Menu as well.


### Theme Options ###

Visit the Appearance -> Theme Options page to set up your theme, upload a logo, choose Google Fonts and add custom CSS. These options will not be deleted when you update your theme.

CSS creates the style of your site. For example, to hide the description of your site, simply paste this code into the custom CSS box:
`#site-description { display: none; }`.


### Widgets ###

Because of the design to make it look like a real magazine, ReMag DOES NOT SUPPORT widgets.


### Menus ###

Our themes use WordPress’s custom menus option. These can be created in Appearance > Menus. Please note that this theme ONLY SUPPORTS first level menus. The theme looks best if you only have couple of menu items to show. To add a new menu to your site:

1. Go to Appearance > Menus.
2. Create a new menu item by clicking the + tab.
3. Select the pages you want to display in your menu and click the Add to Menu button. If you do not see the type of page (category, tag, portfolio, gallery, etc) you want to display, click the Screen Options link at the top of the page and make sure the page type is checked.
4. Once you have set your menu as you want it, click the Save Menu button.
5. Then, assign that menu to the Theme Location box and click Save to ensure your menu appears on the site.

### Featured Images ###

This theme relies heavily on Featured Images. The Featured Image will become the background image of the post on the Home and Archive pages.

To choose the image you want to set as a featured image for this post and click the *Set as Featured Image* button. For best results use images that are at least 1100 pixels wide.

### Post Formats ###

ReMag supports the following post formats &mdash; standard, image, gallery, video and quote &mdash; which are unique layouts for specific types of posts. This will allow you to display a separate layout depending on whether you want to display a gallery or standard text and images on your site.

* Standard Post Formats - Use the Standard Post Format to display whatever you insert into the visual editor on the homepage and on single posts. By default Standard Post Formats and all single posts and pages show 2 columns.

* Image Post Formats - Create a post and assign it to the Image Post Format. Be sure to set a Featured Image. The home and archive pages show the Featured Image as the background and just use the title on top of it. You can click the arrow on the side to reveal the content that post has.

* Gallery Post Formats - On the homepage and archive pages, Gallery that you have embedded is shown on the right column as a grid of images. The Featured image will appear as the background of the whole content area.

To insert a gallery:

1. Click on the Add Media button to launch the Media Uploader tool.
2. Click the Create Gallery option.
3. You can choose to upload images from your computer or you can use images that already exist in your Media Library. You cannot use an image from a URL on the web in your gallery.
4. If you are uploading images, click the Select Files button and navigate to each of your images on your computer. Click the Open button to open each image.
5. Once each of your images has been uploaded, you will have the option to add a title, caption, alternative text and description.
6. After you have added all of the images you wish to display in the gallery, switch to your media library tab and select those images.
7. Then, click the Create a New Gallery button

* Video Post Formats - Create a post and assign it to the Video Post Format. Paste the URL to the video you want to display into the editor. It is highly recommended that you only post the video URL on the editor for best results otherwise the design might not fit well. If you have more content, you might want to choose Standard Post.

* Quote Post Formats - Create a post and assign it to the Quote Post Format. Highlight the text that you want to offset in a quote and click the *blockquote* button to apply blockquote styling to the quoted text. To get a separate style for the author, simply add the Author name like this `&lt;cite&gt;Author Name&lt;/cite&gt;`


### Embed Multimedia into Posts or Pages ###

For externally hosted videos (for example a YouTube or Vimeo video), you can directly paste the link of your video page into the content editor. You do not have to paste the embed code. WordPress will automatically embed the video from the link.

You can easily embed videos from a Video hosting service such as Vimeo or YouTube into your posts or pages.

To add a video:

1. From your WordPress dashboard, add a new post or page (or edit an existing post or page).
2. Paste in your video’s URL, for example https://vimeo.com/31985752.
3. Publish or Update your post or page.

*Please note: If your video is not appearing correctly, remove the ‘s’ from the URL, so https becomes http.*
